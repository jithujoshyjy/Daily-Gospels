# Daily-Gospels
Daily Gospels is an initiative to spread the gospel of god amoung young generations...

Daily Gospels is intented to be a mobile app which helps people to foster their spirituality.
This app is mainy concerned for the Catholic Christians and reflects the spirit of the Jesus Youth Movement.

I warmly welcomes anyone interested in the development of this app. It is mainly base on web technologies like HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
I initially developed this app as a small project alongside my web development studies. Therefore, it is imperfect in many ways; I've used my native language Malayalam along with English in this app.

All in all, it's a mess. The JS codebase is written in JQuery and it looks needlessly complicated. A rewrite to Angular, React or Vue is required.
I left this projet halfway, therefore a lot of work remains to be done.

Although it is far from perfect, the UI and UX is pretty impressive.
So, dear people please help me with this app; lets spread the word of God!
